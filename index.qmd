# Welcome {.unnumbered}

A code review is a process where someone other than the author of a piece of code examines that code.
At Posit, we use code review to maintain the quality of our code and products.

This guide serves as a reference for different aspects of the code review process.
It is intended to be used as a way to get new developers up to speed on how we do code review at Posit, and to serve as a linkable resource when there are questions about aspects of the code review process.

The guide is broken into two sections:

-   How to Review a Pull Request
-   How to Author a Pull Request

At Posit, we mostly use [GitHub](https://github.com/) as the hosting platform for our code, so many details of this guide might refer to aspects specific to doing pull requests using GitHub's tooling.

## Terminology

-   **PR** - Shortened notation for a *pull request*.

## Acknowledgements

This guide is a forked and modified version of Google's [code review principles](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/).
