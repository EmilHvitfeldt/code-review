# Welcome {.unnumbered}

A code review is a process where someone other than the author of a piece of code examines that code.
At Posit, we use code review to maintain the quality of our code and products.

This guide serves as a reference for different aspects of the code review process.
It is intended to be used as a way to get new developers up to speed on how we do code review at Posit, and to serve as a linkable resource when there are questions about aspects of the code review process.

The guide is broken into two sections:

-   How to review a pull request
-   How to author a pull request

At Posit, we mostly use [GitHub](https://github.com/) as the hosting platform for our code, so many details of this guide might refer to aspects specific to doing pull requests using GitHub's tooling.
Additionally, we have a number of R packages that facilitate working on R packages and authoring/reviewing pull requests.
In particular, you will see references to [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) and [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) throughout this guide.

## Terminology

-   **PR** - Shortened notation for a *pull request*.
-   **Internal PR** - A pull request that is both authored and reviewed by Posit employees.
-   **External PR** - A pull request that is authored by a community member, and reviewed by a Posit employee.
