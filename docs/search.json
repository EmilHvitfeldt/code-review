As a reviewer, it is encouraged to leave comments that help a developer learn something new. Linking out to sections of the style guide, design guide, or this code review guide are ways to point to a concrete source of truth that the developer can read to align their future code with Posit standards.\nPair programming is also an excellent way to perform a code review. One way to do this is to have the reviewer live-review a pull request, which often teaches the developer what the reviewer looks for when they review PRs, and gives both parties a way to have an immediate discussion about any tricky design points. It is generally useful to document any insights from the pair programming session as a comment in the code review."

Any purely stylistic point (whitespace, etc.) that is not in the style guide is a matter of personal preference or is something that should be hashed out and added to the style guide. The most important rule about style is to be consistent with what is already in the codebase.\nAspects of software design are almost never a pure style issue or just a personal preference. They are based on underlying principles and should be weighed on those principles, not simply by personal opinion. Sometimes there are a few valid options. If the author can demonstrate (either through data or based on solid engineering principles) that several approaches are equally valid, then the reviewer should accept the preference of the author. Otherwise the choice is dictated by standard principles of software design.\nIf no other rule applies, then the reviewer may ask the author to be consistent with what is in the current codebase, as long as that doesn’t worsen the overall code health of the system."

Does it integrate well with the rest of your system?\nHopefully, you and the PR author aligned on the design aspect of the PR before they worked on it. If not, it is often worth pausing and having a separate conversation about the overall design rather than directly reviewing their PR, as that conversation might result in the PR being completely rewritten or closed altogether."

The “users” are usually both end-users (when they are affected by the change) and developers (who will have to “use” this code in the future).\nMostly, we expect developers to test PRs well-enough that they work correctly by the time they get to code review. However, as the reviewer you should still be thinking about edge cases, trying to think like a user, and making sure that there are no bugs that you see just by reading the code. In R, typical edge cases to watch out for include checking what happens if the user passes in an object of an unexpected type, or what happens if they pass in an object of zero length.\nAn important part of validating the functionality of a PR is trying it out locally. This is particularly important if the PR has a user-facing impact, such as a new function or argument. At Posit, we generally check out PRs on R packages locally using usethis::pr_fetch(<pr-number>). This is a great time to try out edge cases in the code. It also makes it very easy to create a reprex that you can share with the PR author in a GitHub comment if you do find an issue."

Are functions too complex? “Too complex” usually means “can’t be understood quickly by code readers.” A way to check for this is to try and “run” the function in your head from top to bottom. If it is exceedingly difficult to do this, the PR might be too complex.\nComplexity can also mean that developers are likely to introduce bugs when they try to call or modify that code in the future.\nA particular type of complexity is over-engineering, where developers have made the code more generic than it needs to be, or added functionality that isn’t presently needed by the system. Reviewers should be especially vigilant about over-engineering. Encourage developers to solve the problem they know needs to be solved now, not the problem that the developer speculates might need to be solved in the future. The future problem should be solved once it arrives and you can see its actual shape and requirements in the physical universe."

If there is a corresponding issue or PR on GitHub that is linked to the test, it is useful for forensic purposes to include the issue number in the test description, like:\n\ntest_that(\"`my_function()` throws an error when given strings (#553)\")\n\nRecent versions of the RStudio IDE will automatically generate a hyperlink from this issue number to the corresponding URL on GitHub, which makes these extremely valuable for looking up historical context of a particular bug.\nMake sure that the tests in the PR are correct, sensible, and useful. Tests do not test themselves, and we rarely write tests for our tests—a human must ensure that tests are valid.\nTests should also strive to be as minimal as possible. When a user opens an issue with a bug report, chances are that they have included an example that is tailored to their use case, but isn’t a minimal example of the bug in question. When you write a test for the bug fix, it is worth spending time making the example as minimal as possible so it isolates the bug and is easy to understand in the future. Remember that tests have to be maintained too!\nCross-package integration tests are more difficult, but the tidymodels ecosystem accomplishes this using a separate GitHub-only R package named extratests that is run on a daily basis."

Without the context provided by that comment, it can be a little difficult to know why that branch is there. Particularly challenging comments like this one should come with tests that can provide concrete examples of the issue, like these in tidyr.\nNote that comments are different from documentation of functions, which should instead express the purpose of a piece of code, how it should be used, and how it behaves when used."

The important thing is that if there is a point of contention about style in a PR, we can point to the style guide to resolve it.\nThe author of the PR should not include major style changes combined with other changes. It makes it hard to see what is being changed in the PR, makes merges and rollbacks more complex, and causes other problems. If the author wants to reformat the whole file, request that they send you just the reformatting as one PR, and then send another PR with their functional changes after that."

Per our code review principles, the style guide is the absolute authority: if something is required by the style guide, the PR should follow the guidelines.\nIn some cases, the style guide makes recommendations rather than declaring requirements. In these cases, it’s a judgment call whether the new code should be consistent with the recommendations or the surrounding code.\nConsistency is also heavily related to naming, and the reviewer should ensure that the author has chosen function names, argument names, and local variable names that are consistent with the rest of the codebase. Consistent naming makes code significantly easier to understand, because it lowers your cognitive burden if you know that loc always stands for an integer value corresponding to a vector index. This is particularly helpful in R, since static typing isn’t available to provide this information for you."

This can be useful for other developers to reference as they use common internal helpers. One example of this is tidyr:::df_append(), which includes this internal function documentation marked with @noRd.\nIt is generally also good practice to provide a news bullet in a NEWS.md file that is associated with the change. This is another place where providing the GitHub issue or PR number is useful, like:\n* `my_function()` now checks that `x` is a numeric value (#565).\nIf there isn’t a GitHub issue that corresponds to your bug fix or feature, you can be caught in a chicken-and-egg scenario where you need a GitHub PR number to link to, but you haven’t opened the PR yet. One way to resolve this is to:\n\nGo ahead and open the PR without the commit changing the NEWS.md file.\nAdd the news bullet and link to the now open PR.\nPush with a commit message like NEWS bullet."

Some things like data files, generated code, or large data structures you can scan over sometimes, but don’t scan over a human-written function or block of code and assume that what’s inside of it is okay. Obviously some code deserves more careful scrutiny than other code—that’s a judgment call that you have to make—but you should at least be sure that you understand what all the code is doing.\nIf reviewing every line is too hard and is slowing down the review, then you should let the developer know and ask them to clarify it (possibly providing suggestions of your own, if possible). This also applies to code that you understand, but it took a long time for you to figure it out (or you had to run it locally to understand it). If you can’t understand the code, it is likely that other reviewers won’t be able to either! Taking a moment to have the developer clarify confusing sections of code will help future developers when it is modified further.\nIf you understand the code but you don’t feel qualified to do some part of the review, it is perfectly acceptable (and preferred!) that you let the author know, and suggest that they request a review from another developer who has more expertise in that area."

    "text": "2.11 Context\nIt is often helpful to look at the PR in a broad context. Usually the code review tool on GitHub will only show you a few lines of code around the parts that are being changed. Sometimes you have to look at the whole file to be sure that the change actually makes sense. For example, you might see only four new lines being added, but when you look at the whole file, you see those four lines are in a 50-line helper that now really needs to be broken up into smaller functions.\nIt’s also useful to think about the PR in the context of the system as a whole. Is this PR improving the code health of the system or is it making the whole system more complex, less tested, etc.? PRs should always maintain or improve the overall health of the codebase. Most systems become complex through many small changes that add up, so it’s important to prevent even small complexities in new changes.\nSometimes the timing of the PR isn’t right. It is possible that the codebase may need restructuring before a PR can be accepted. You can generally recognize this when the PR has a large number of changes to parts of the codebase that are seemingly unrelated to the purpose of the PR itself. In those cases, it is often worth suggesting that the author submit a few smaller focused PRs first that prepare the codebase for the larger PR. This reduces the complexity of the larger PR, making it easier to understand and faster to review."

If this change shouldn’t have happened in the first place, please respond immediately with an explanation of why the change should not be happening. When you reject a change like this, it’s also a good idea to suggest to the developer what they should have done instead.\nFor example, you might say “Looks like you put some good work into this, thanks! However, we’re actually going in the direction of removing the FooWidget system that you’re modifying here, and so we don’t want to make any new modifications to it right now. How about instead you refactor our new BarWidget class?”\nNote that not only did the reviewer reject the current CL and provide an alternative suggestion, but they did it courteously. This kind of courtesy is important because we want to show that we respect each other as developers even when we disagree.\nIf you get more than a few CLs that represent changes you don’t want to make, you should consider re-working your team’s development process or the posted process for external contributors so that there is more communication before CLs are written.

Often, there is one file that has the largest number of logical changes, and it’s the major piece of the CL. Look at these major parts first. This helps give context to all of the smaller parts of the CL, and generally accelerates doing the code review. If the CL is too large for you to figure out which parts are the major parts, ask the developer what you should look at first, or ask them to split up the CL into multiple CLs.\nIf you see some major design problems with this part of the CL, you should send those comments immediately, even if you don’t have time to review the rest of the CL right now. In fact, reviewing the rest of the CL might be a waste of time, because if the design problems are significant enough, a lot of the other code under review is going to disappear and not matter anyway.\nThere are two major reasons it’s so important to send these major design comments out immediately:\n\nDevelopers often mail a CL and then immediately start new work based on that CL while they wait for review. If there are major design problems in the CL you’re reviewing, they’re also going to have to re-work their later CL. You want to catch them before they’ve done too much extra work on top of the problematic design.\nMajor design changes take longer to do than small changes.

The speed of individual development is important, it’s just not as important as the velocity of the entire team.\nWhen code reviews are slow, several things happen:\n\nThe velocity of the team as a whole is decreased. Yes, the individual who doesn’t respond quickly to the review gets other work done. However, new features and bug fixes for the rest of the team are delayed by days, weeks, or months as each CL waits for review and re-review.\nDevelopers start to protest the code review process. If a reviewer only responds every few days, but requests major changes to the CL each time, that can be frustrating and difficult for developers. Often, this is expressed as complaints about how “strict” the reviewer is being. If the reviewer requests the same substantial changes (changes which really do improve code health), but responds quickly every time the developer makes an update, the complaints tend to disappear. Most complaints about the code review process are actually resolved by making the process faster.\nCode health can be impacted. When reviews are slow, there is increased pressure to allow developers to submit CLs that are not as good as they could be. Slow reviews also discourage code cleanups, refactorings, and further improvements to existing CLs."

So interrupting yourself while coding is actually more expensive to the team than making another developer wait a bit for a code review.\nInstead, wait for a break point in your work before you respond to a request for review.

(Note: none of this means you should interrupt coding even to send a response like this—send the response at a reasonable break point in your work.)\nIt is important that reviewers spend enough time on review that they are certain their “LGTM” means “this code meets our standards.” However, individual responses should still ideally be fast."

Reviewers learn to respond quickly and not add unnecessary latency into the review process.

For example:\nBad: “Why did you use threads here when there’s obviously no benefit to be gained from concurrency?”\nGood: “The concurrency model here is adding complexity to the system without any actual performance benefit that I can see.

You are not required to do detailed design of a solution or write code for the developer.\nThis doesn’t mean the reviewer should be unhelpful, though. In general you should strike an appropriate balance between pointing out problems and providing direct guidance. Pointing out problems and letting the developer make a decision often helps the developer learn, and makes it easier to do code reviews. It also can result in a better solution, because the developer is closer to the code than the reviewer is.\nHowever, sometimes direct instructions, suggestions, or even code are more helpful. The primary goal of code review is to get the best CL possible. A secondary goal is improving the skills of developers so that they require less and less review over time.\nRemember that people learn from reinforcement of what they are doing well and not just what they could do better. If you see things you like in the CL, comment on those too! Examples: developer cleaned up a messy algorithm, added exemplary test coverage, or you as the reviewer learned something from the CL. Just as with all comments, include why you liked something, further encouraging the developer to continue good practices."

In this case the reviewer should further explain why they believe that their suggestion is correct. A good explanation demonstrates both an understanding of the developer’s reply, and additional information about why the change is being requested.\nIn particular, when the reviewer believes their suggestion will improve code health, they should continue to advocate for the change, if they believe the resulting code quality improvement justifies the additional work requested. Improving code health tends to happen in small steps.\nSometimes it takes a few rounds of explaining a suggestion before it really sinks in.

They don’t want to go through another round of review just to get this CL in. So they say they will clean something up in a later CL, and thus you should LGTM this CL now. Some developers are very good about this, and will immediately write a follow-up CL that fixes the issue. However, experience shows that as more time passes after a developer writes the original CL, the less likely this clean up is to happen. In fact, usually unless the developer does the clean up immediately after the present CL, it never happens. This isn’t because developers are irresponsible, but because they have a lot of work to do and the cleanup gets lost or forgotten in the press of other work. Thus, it is usually best to insist that the developer clean up their CL now, before the code is in the codebase and “done.” Letting people “clean things up later” is a common way for codebases to degenerate.\nIf a CL introduces new complexity, it must be cleaned up before submission unless it is an emergency. If the CL exposes surrounding problems and they can’t be addressed right now, the developer should file a bug for the cleanup and assign it to themselves so that it doesn’t get lost. They can optionally also write a TODO comment in the code that references the filed bug."

This replaces the methods on Borglet that delegate to a TimeKeeper.\nAllowing Tasks to supply Now is a step toward eliminating the dependency on Borglet. Eventually, collaborators that depend on getting Now from the Task should be changed to use a TimeKeeper directly, but this has been an accommodation to refactoring in small steps.\nContinuing the long-range goal of refactoring the Borglet Hierarchy.\n\nThe first line describes what the CL does and how this is a change from the past. The rest of the description talks about the specific implementation, the context of the CL, that the solution isn’t ideal, and possible future direction. It also explains why this change is being made.\n\n\n7.4.3 Small CL that needs some context\nExample:\n\nCreate a Python3 build rule for status.py.\nThis allows consumers who are already using this as in Python3 to depend on a rule that is next to the original status build rule instead of somewhere in their own tree. It encourages new consumers to use Python3 if they can, instead of Python2, and significantly simplifies some automated build file refactoring tools being worked on currently.\n\nThe first sentence describes what’s actually being done.

It’s easier for a reviewer to find five minutes several times to review small CLs than to set aside a 30 minute block to review one large CL.\nReviewed more thoroughly. With large changes, reviewers and authors tend to get frustrated by large volumes of detailed commentary shifting back and forth—sometimes to the point where important points get missed or dropped.\nLess likely to introduce bugs. Since you’re making fewer changes, it’s easier for you and your reviewer to reason effectively about the impact of the CL and see if a bug has been introduced.\nLess wasted work if they are rejected. If you write a huge CL and then your reviewer says that the overall direction is wrong, you’ve wasted a lot of work.\nEasier to merge. Working on a large CL takes a long time, so you will have lots of conflicts when you merge, and you will have to merge frequently.\nEasier to design well. It’s a lot easier to polish the design and code health of a small change than it is to refine all the details of a large change.\nLess blocking on reviews. Sending self-contained portions of your overall change allows you to continue coding while you wait for your current CL in review.\nSimpler to roll back. A large CL will more likely touch files that get updated between the initial CL submission and a rollback CL, complicating the rollback (the intermediate CLs will probably need to be rolled back too).\n\nNote that reviewers have discretion to reject your change outright for the sole reason of it being too large. Usually they will thank you for your contribution but request that you somehow make it into a series of smaller changes. It can be a lot of work to split up a change after you’ve already written it, or require lots of time arguing about why the reviewer should accept your large change. It’s easier to just write small CLs in the first place."

    "text": "8.2 What is Small?\nIn general, the right size for a CL is one self-contained change. This means that:\n\nThe CL makes a minimal change that addresses just one thing. This is usually just one part of a feature, rather than a whole feature at once. In general it’s better to err on the side of writing CLs that are too small vs. CLs that are too large. Work with your reviewer to find out what an acceptable size is.\nThe CL should include related test code.\nEverything the reviewer needs to understand about the CL (except future development) is in the CL, the CL’s description, the existing codebase, or a CL they’ve already reviewed.\nThe system will continue to work well for its users and for the developers after the CL is checked in.\nThe CL is not so small that its implications are difficult to understand. If you add a new API, you should include a usage of the API in the same CL so that reviewers can better understand how the API will be used. This also prevents checking in unused APIs.\n\nThere are no hard and fast rules about how large is “too large.” 100 lines is usually a reasonable size for a CL, and 1000 lines is usually too large, but it’s up to the judgment of your reviewer. The number of files that a change is spread across also affects its “size.” A 200-line change in one file might be okay, but spread across 50 files it would usually be too large.\nKeep in mind that although you have been intimately involved with your code from the moment you started to write it, the reviewer often has no context. What seems like an acceptably-sized CL to you might be overwhelming to your reviewer. When in doubt, write CLs that are smaller than you think you need to write. Reviewers rarely complain about getting CLs that are too small."

These CLs can be larger, although some of the caveats from above (such as merging and testing) still apply.\n\n\n8.3.1 Splitting by Files\nAnother way to split up a CL is by groupings of files that will require different reviewers but are otherwise self-contained changes.\nFor example: you send off one CL for modifications to a protocol buffer and another CL for changes to the code that uses that proto. You have to submit the proto CL before the code CL, but they can both be reviewed simultaneously. If you do this, you might want to inform both sets of reviewers about the other CL that you wrote, so that they have context for your changes.\nAnother example: you send one CL for a code change and another for the configuration or experiment that uses that code; this is easier to roll back too, if necessary, as configuration/experiment files are sometimes pushed to production faster than code changes."

That is a serious breach of professional etiquette that will live forever in the code review tool. If you are too angry or annoyed to respond kindly, then walk away from your computer for a while, or work on something else until you feel calm enough to reply politely.\nIn general, if a reviewer isn’t providing feedback in a way that’s constructive and polite, explain this to them in person. If you can’t talk to them in person or on a video call, then send them a private email. Explain to them in a kind way what you don’t like and what you’d like them to do differently.

If the code can’t be clarified, add a code comment that explains why the code is there. If a comment seems pointless, only then should your response be an explanation in the code review tool.\nIf a reviewer didn’t understand some piece of your code, it’s likely other future readers of the code won’t understand either. Writing a response in the code review tool doesn’t help future code readers, but clarifying your code or adding code comments does help them."

    "text": "9.3 Think Collaboratively\nWriting a CL can take a lot of work. It’s often really satisfying to finally send one out for review, feel like it’s done, and be pretty sure that no further work is needed. It can be frustrating to receive comments asking for changes, especially if you don’t agree with them.\nAt times like this, take a moment to step back and consider if the reviewer is providing valuable feedback that will help the codebase and Google. Your first question to yourself should always be, “Do I understand what the reviewer is asking for?”\nIf you can’t answer that question, ask the reviewer for clarification.\nAnd then, if you understand the comments but disagree with them, it’s important to think collaboratively, not combatively or defensively:\nBad: “No, I’m not going to do that.”\nGood: “I went with X because of [these pros/cons] with [these tradeoffs]. My understanding is that using Y would be worse because of [these reasons]. Are you suggesting that Y better serves the original tradeoffs, that we should weigh the tradeoffs differently, or something else?”\nRemember, courtesy and respect should always be a first priority. If you disagree with the reviewer, find ways to collaborate: ask for clarifications, discuss pros/cons, and provide explanations of why your method of doing things is better for the codebase, users, and/or Google.\nSometimes, you might know something about the users, codebase, or CL that the reviewer doesn’t know. Fix the code where appropriate, and engage your reviewer in discussion, including giving them more context. Usually you can come to some consensus between yourself and the reviewer based on technical facts."

    "text": "10.1 What Is An Emergency?\nAn emergency CL would be a small change that: allows a major launch to continue instead of rolling back, fixes a bug significantly affecting users in production, handles a pressing legal issue, closes a major security hole, etc.\nIn emergencies we really do care about the speed of the entire code review process, not just the speed of response. In this case only, the reviewer should care more about the speed of the review and the correctness of the code (does it actually resolve the emergency?) than anything else. Also (perhaps obviously) such reviews should take priority over all other code reviews, when they come up.\nHowever, after the emergency is resolved you should look over the emergency CLs again and give them a more thorough review."

    "text": "10.3 What Is a Hard Deadline?\nA hard deadline is one where something disastrous would happen if you miss it. For example:\n\nSubmitting your CL by a certain date is necessary for a contractual obligation.\nYour product will completely fail in the marketplace if not released by a certain date.\nSome hardware manufacturers only ship new hardware once a year. If you miss the deadline to submit code to them, that could be disastrous, depending on what type of code you’re trying to ship.\n\nDelaying a release for a week is not disastrous. Missing an important conference might be disastrous, but often is not.\nMost deadlines are soft deadlines, not hard deadlines. They represent a desire for a feature to be done by a certain time. They are important, but you shouldn’t be sacrificing code health to make them.\nIf you have a long release cycle (several weeks) it can be tempting to sacrifice code review quality to get a feature in before the next cycle. However, this pattern, if repeated, is a common way for projects to build up overwhelming technical debt. If developers are routinely submitting CLs near the end of the cycle that “must get in” with only superficial review, then the team should modify its process so that large feature changes happen early in the cycle and have enough time for good review."
